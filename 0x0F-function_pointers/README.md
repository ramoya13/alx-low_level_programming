#0x0F. C - Function pointers

This directory contains files of solutions of tasks done during the
**ALX Fulstack Software Engineering Programme**. The project was aimed at learning
function pointers in the C Programming language. The project covered how to use function pointers,
what function pointers hold and where function pointers point to in memory.

## Project files
These are files for the solutions of tasks undertaken during the project.

- 0-print_name.c - a function that prints a name.

- 1-array_iterator.c -  a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.

- 2-int_index.c - a function that searches for an integer.

- 3-op_functions.c, 3-main.c, 3-get_op_func.c, 3-calc.h -  a program that performs simple operations.

- 100-main_opcodes.c - a program that prints the opcodes of its own main function.
