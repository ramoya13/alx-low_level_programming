## ALX low level programming in C

C is widely regarded as one of the primary programming languages used for low-level programming.
It offers several features and characteristics that make it suitable for this purpose including efficiency, portability 
and its close relationship with the hardware.
* efficiency
  C allows developers to write code that directly interacts with underlying hardware, providing fine grained control
  over system resources. This enables optimization at low level.
* portability
  C is highly portable. Can be compiled and run on platforms and architecture with minimal or no modification.
* close relationship with hardware
  C has close realationship with hardware resources such as memory, registers and I/O operations. It allows direct
  manipulation of memory addresses.
