## ALX low level programming in C

C is widely regarded as one of the primary programming languages used for low-level programming.
It offers several features and characteristics that make it suitable for this purpose including efficiency, portability 
and its close relationship with the hardware.
- **efficiency**
  
  C allows developers to write code that directly interacts with underlying hardware, providing fine grained control
  over system resources. This enables optimization at low level.
- **portability**
  
  C is highly portable. Can be compiled and run on platforms and architecture with minimal or no modification.
- **Close relationship with hardware**
  
  C has close realationship with hardware resources such as memory, registers and I/O operations. It allows direct
  manipulation of memory addresses. Low level languages are still used in IOT and machine learning.
